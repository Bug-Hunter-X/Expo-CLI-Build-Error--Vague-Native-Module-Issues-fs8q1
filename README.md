# Expo CLI Build Error: Vague Native Module Issues

This repository demonstrates a common, yet frustrating, error encountered when building Expo projects that depend on native modules. The error messages from the Expo CLI are often unhelpful, making troubleshooting challenging.  This example outlines the problem and provides a solution.

**Problem:**

The project uses a native module (e.g., a library for accessing device features) that isn't correctly configured for Expo's managed workflow.  This leads to build failures during `expo prebuild` or `expo build`, with vague error messages.

**Solution:**

The solution involves ensuring the native module is compatible with Expo and properly integrated.  This might involve using an Expo-compatible version of the library, or configuring the native module using Expo's recommended methods (e.g., using `expo install` and configuring the project appropriately).

**Steps to Reproduce (expoBug.js):**

1.  Create a new Expo project.
2.  Install a native module (replace with a known problematic module).
3.  Attempt to build the project using `expo prebuild` or `expo build`.
4.  Observe the vague error message.

**Solution (expoBugSolution.js):**

1.  Review the native module's documentation to ensure compatibility with Expo.
2.  If necessary, use an Expo-compatible version.
3.  Follow Expo's guidelines for integrating native modules in managed workflow projects.
4.  Rebuild the project.
