This error occurs when using the Expo CLI with a project that has a dependency on a native module that isn't properly configured for the Expo managed workflow.  This often manifests as a build error during the `expo prebuild` or `expo build` process.  The error message might not be very specific, potentially mentioning issues with linking or native code compilation.
